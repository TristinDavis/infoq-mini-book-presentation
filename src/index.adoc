== Writing a book is hard
// 1 min
[build=items]
* It’s hard enough coming up with the idea, but writing is hard.
* It’s easy enough to write it in Word (or Google Docs), _right_?
* Copying and pasting code and images into Word or Google Docs is easy.
* As writers, we're often limited by our tools.
* http://ascidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] to the rescue!

== What is Asciidoctor?

== Asciidoctor
* An open source implementation of http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] in Ruby
* A _fast_ text processor & publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc to HTML5, DocBook & more
* Write in plain text, import your code and images
* Code review and copy edit using Git and code reviews
* Publish as HTML, PDF, EBUB, MOBI and printed books

== The Best Part?
// Costs a lot less!

== My Asciidoctor Experience

// Was expected to be most expensive, ended up being cheapest
