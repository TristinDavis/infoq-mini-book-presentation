== Writing a book is hard
[build=items]
* It’s easy enough coming up with an idea, but writing is hard
* It’s easy enough to write it in Word (or Google Docs), _right_?
[build=items]
** Copying and pasting code and images into Google Docs is easy
** Updating them is not
* As writers, we're often limited by our tools
* http://ascidoctor.org[Asciidoctor] to the rescue!

== What is Asciidoctor?

== Asciidoctor
[build=items]
* An open source implementation of http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/[AsciiDoc] in Ruby
* A _fast_ text processor & publishing toolchain for converting AsciiDoc to HTML5, DocBook & more
* Write in plain text, import your code and images
* Code review and copy edit using Git and code reviews
* Publish as HTML, PDF, EBUB, MOBI and printed books

== The Best Part?
// Costs a lot less!

== My Asciidoctor Experience
[build=items]
* End of 2015: Had a goal to write a JHipster Mini-Book for http://infoq.com[InfoQ]
* Chose Asciidoctor because I wanted it to be like an open source project
* Used https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-gradle-examples[asciidoctor-to-all-example] as a starting point
* Used JIRA Cloud to create tasks, organize sprints and track progress
* Used Bitbucket to host the book's source control in Git
* Used IntelliJ IDEA to write, and https://www.browsersync.io/[Browsersync] to see changes immediately

== Asciidoctor @ InfoQ
[build=items]
* InfoQ recommended I use Word or Google Docs
* Agreed to Asciidoctor, but expect it be most expensive mini-book
* Figured it out, with a great team
* Extracted template to https://github.com/mraible/infoq-mini-book[infoq-mini-book]
* https://twitter.com/mojavelinux[Dan Allen] and http://asciidocfx.com/[AsciidocFX] were a big help

== Writing Asciidoctor

== Developing an InfoQ Mini-Book
[build=items]
* `git clone https://github.com/mraible/infoq-mini-book`
* Run `gradlew` followed by `gradlew watch`
* Install https://nodejs.org/[Node.js] and run `npm install`
* Run `grunt`
* Use IntelliJ IDEA, Atom, Sublime Text or AsciidocFX to edit

== InfoQ Editing Process
[build=items]
* Share your Git repository with your editor
* Editor creates pull requests by section
* Add comments and collaborate on changes
* Accept pull request and merge

== InfoQ Publishing Process
[build=items]
* Install https://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html?docId=1000765211[KindleGen] for MOBI
* Create HTML, PDF, EPUB and MOBI by running `build.sh`
* `asciidoctor-pdf-extensions.rb` customizes PDF output
* Recent improvements by https://twitter.com/mojavelinux[@mojavelinux] allow for https://www.lulu.com/[Lulu] printing
